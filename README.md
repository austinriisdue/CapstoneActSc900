# CapstoneActSc900
All programs required to replicate the results presented in Austin Riis-Due's ActSc 900 Capstone are contained in this repo. Use GMDB & GMAB Simulation Study to replicate results in Section 2, GMDB & GMAB Simulation Study Scenario Testing for the sensitivity testing in Section 3, and the "Surrender PDE Solving" to replicate results in Sections 4 through 6. If you run the code with the seeds set as given, you will get exactly the results in the project document, but you can change parameters up to get other results.

No guarantee of how fast this will run on your machine, it was coded by a math major.

Since this is a public repo:
If you are using this to price insurance or for any other purpose, I accept no legal responsibility for any financial losses suffered by you or any firm you are a part of. You bear the full risk of using this program for anything other than its intended purpose as an educational resource.

Thanks for checking out my work,
-Austin
